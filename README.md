# Grades Tracker App

## Overview
The Grades Tracker App is a web application designed for grade school teachers to manage student grades in a fun and engaging way. The app allows teachers to maintain a list of students, adjust their "account balances" based on test scores and behavior, and provides students with a way to log in and check their balances.

## Features
- **Teacher Dashboard**: Teachers can manage student balances and view overall performance.
- **Student Dashboard**: Students can view their score and history.
- **Login System**: Secure login for both students and teachers.
- **Transaction History**: Keeps track of all score changes made to student accounts.
